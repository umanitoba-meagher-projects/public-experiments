        "## What the Notebook Can Be Used For:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Dataset Exploration:** The notebook enables exploration of image datasets by automatically detecting and highlighting objects of interest. This is useful for quickly assessing the content and quality of a dataset, identifying labeling inconsistencies, or verifying the presence of target objects (in our case urban animals).\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Educational Purposes & Demonstrations:** The notebook shows how Python code, scripting, and machine learning models can be applied to image-based tasks. By extracting bounding box coordinates, class labels, and confidence scores, the structured data can be used for further analysis such as statistical summaries, dataset curation, or as input features for other machine learning models.\n",
        "\n",
        "## How the Notebook Can Be Adapted:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Integration with Spatial Design:** The methodology can be extended to site analysis or spatial design projects by applying object detection to images of built environments, landscapes, or architectural sites. Detected features can inform spatial mapping, usage studies, or environmental assessments.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Variables & Customization:** Variables like `confidence_threshold` (see Cell 7) and `image_dir` (see Cell 6) can be adjusted to refine detection sensitivity or to point to different image sources. By changing the `image_dir` variable in the code block in Cell 6 you can process any directory of images.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Different Data Sources:** The Borealis API functions can be modified to work with other data repositories, or the image directory detection can be pointed to local or cloud storage locations.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Extended Analysis:** The detection results can be exported to CSV or JSON formats for further statistical analysis, or integrated with spatial analysis tools for geographic applications."
