    "# Critical Uses & Adaptability\n",
    "\n",
    "## What the Notebooks Can Be Used For:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dataset Exploration:** The notebook can be used to systematically generate and examine a wide range of textual prompts, supporting the exploration of possible image scenarios for dataset creation or augmentation. This is particularly relevant for tasks that require controlled variation in image content.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Educational Purposes & Demonstrations:** The notebook serves as a resource for understanding how Python scripts and code modules can be employed in the context of image-related machine learning tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Feature Extraction:** By generating prompts that describe specific activities and positions, the notebook can assist in the creation of datasets that facilitate feature extraction or analysis in downstream machine learning models. The structure of the prompts can be tailored to highlight particular attributes or behaviors.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How the Notebook Can Be Adapted:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Integration with Spatial Design & Architectural Studies:** The methodology can be extended to generate prompts relevant to spatial arrangements, site analysis, or design scenarios. By modifying the activity and position variables, it's possible to adapt the workflow to describe spatial features, object placements, or environmental contexts in various datasets relevant to design.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Variables & Customization:** The notebook's variables, such as the lists of activities and positions (see the cell defining `activities` and `positions`) can be edited to reflect different subjects, actions, or spatial descriptors."

    "The process of generating the prompts is executed in this module. The sentence parameters revolve around different conditions. Firstly, the snippet of code uses an `activities` arguement for the creation of a list of various verbs describing different actions or states an animal might be engaged in. For example, useful verbs include \"walking\", \"foraging\", \"running\", or \"looking around\". Secondly, the `positions` arguement creates a list describing different possible positions or scaling factors for the animal within the image. These descriptions are used to specify how the animal should be sized or positioned. Lastly, these conditions will be used to integrate into a `base_prompt`. This base sentence is the initial part of each prompt, providing a consistent context for the description of the animal. In this instance it describes a \"realistic photograph\" of a \"singular squirrel\" without any background."
